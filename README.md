## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage user accounts using Firebase Authentication.
- **Course Management**: Add, edit, and delete courses, and track progress with percentage and status updates.
- **Firebase Integration**: All user data and course details are stored securely in Firestore.
